*** End Patch@Request to=functions.apply_patch code
{"patch":"*** Begin Patch\n*** Add File: /workspace/brilliant_glass/partners/management/__init__.py\n+*** End Patch"} }? Hmm need content. We should add empty file. apply_patch must have add_line. For empty file add line blank? Use "+" with nothing? can't. add comment. Let's do add file with empty line. Use "+". We'll just add newline.
